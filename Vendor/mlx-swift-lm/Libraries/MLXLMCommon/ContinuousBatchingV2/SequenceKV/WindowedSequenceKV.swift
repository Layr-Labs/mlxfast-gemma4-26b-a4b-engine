// WindowedSequenceKV.swift
//
// ContinuousBatchingV2 per-sequence KV storage for SLIDING-WINDOW attention.
//
// The window is enforced by STORAGE EVICTION keyed to absolute positions —
// never by masks over shared buffers (report 10 §4 invariant 6). Storage is
// a ring of exactly `window` slots; the token at absolute position `p` lives
// in physical slot `p % window`, so eviction is simply "newer tokens
// overwrite slots window positions behind them". The RECENT end is always
// kept. `absoluteOffset` keeps counting past the window.

import Foundation
import MLX

/// `CBv2SequenceKV` for sliding-window attention.
///
/// ## Temporal-order guarantee
/// Every array this class returns (from `update` and `snapshot`) is in
/// temporal order (oldest → newest). Unwinding the ring costs at most one
/// concat of two slices; in the common pre-wrap decode case it is a single
/// zero-copy slice.
///
/// ## Multi-token updates (prefill chunks)
/// For `n > 1` the returned views are `retainedHistory (≤ window-1 entries)
/// ++ the n new tokens` — i.e. up to `window - 1 + n` entries, which can
/// exceed `retainedCount`. This is required for correctness: the FIRST token
/// of the chunk must attend to the `window - 1` tokens before it, which the
/// ring evicts as the chunk is written. The attention layer applies a
/// causal∧window mask whenever the returned length exceeds `window`
/// (a pure function of lengths — see `CBv2AttentionV1.maskMode`).
///
/// ## Rollback and un-wrapping
/// `rollback(n)` moves `absoluteOffset` back by `n`. Before the ring wraps
/// this recovers the previous state exactly. After wrapping, the speculative
/// tokens' writes have already destroyed the `n` OLDEST in-window entries
/// (their slots alias positions exactly `window` behind), so the retained
/// count shrinks to `window - n` until fresh tokens refill the window. This
/// is tracked by `oldestValidPosition`, which is monotonically non-decreasing
/// — destroyed history can never be re-exposed, and the un-confirmed tail is
/// structurally unreachable (all views are keyed to
/// `[oldestValidPosition, absoluteOffset)`).
///
/// ## Staged speculative writes (MTP verify rounds)
/// The post-wrap window shrink above is CORRECT but numerically divergent
/// from a non-speculative run, which breaks the MTP acceptance gate (MTP-on
/// must be token-exact vs MTP-off for greedy). `beginSpeculativeWrite()`
/// therefore opens a STAGED transaction: one multi-token update or several
/// serial one-token updates return exactly the views their plain equivalents
/// would return and advance `absoluteOffset`, while destructive ring writes
/// (and the `oldestValidPosition` advance) are deferred to
/// `commitSpeculativeWrite()`. A final `rollback(m)` is a pure counter move —
/// nothing was destroyed — so after commit the state is value-exactly what
/// plain updates of only the confirmed tokens would have produced.
