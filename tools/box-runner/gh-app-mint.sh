# gh-app-mint.sh -- mint short-lived GitHub App credentials for JIT
# self-hosted-runner registration. NO PAT: the only durable secret this
# script ever touches is the GitHub App private key, and only a PATH to it
# (GH_APP_KEY) -- never key material -- lives in this file or any env var it
# sets. Everything this script emits is short-lived (installation token,
# ~1h, and explicitly REVOKED by this script once used) or single-use (the
# JIT runner config it prints).
#
# Adapted from the box-3-proven qwen/bench lineage
# (the operator's machine-scripts repository, read-only reference -- this
# script does not modify that repo) for tools/box-runner/. Two load-bearing
# changes from that lineage:
#
#   1. FAIL-CLOSED, NO BAKED-IN IDENTITY. The original carried literal
#      fallback defaults for GH_APP_ID / GH_REPO / GH_INSTALLATION_ID, so a
#      missing config file silently degraded to a hardcoded box-3 identity --
#      its own header documents that this is exactly how a different box
#      once kept registering against the wrong repository after a
#      promotion, because editing the config file alone had no effect while
#      the literal fallback was silently winning. This script refuses to run
#      at all, with a named error, if GH_APP_ID, GH_APP_KEY, or
#      GH_RUNNER_REPO is unset: there is no repository or identity this
#      script will register against by accident or by copied default.
#   2. GH_RUNNER_REPO, not a hardcoded GH_REPO. The public repository name
#      for this track is not settled yet (see tools/box-runner/README.md's
#      coupling note); every caller (supervisor.sh, install.sh, an operator)
#      must supply it via env, and this script has no opinion about it.
#
# Usage:
#   gh-app-mint.sh installation-id            -> prints the installation id
#   gh-app-mint.sh token                      -> prints a 1h installation token
#   gh-app-mint.sh jitconfig <runner-name> <labels-csv>
#                                              -> prints base64 JIT config (single use)
#
# Required env (fail-closed; none of these three has a default):
#   GH_APP_ID           GitHub App id.
#   GH_APP_KEY          Path to the App's RS256 private key. Only the path
#                        lives here -- the file's permissions and custody are
#                        the operator's responsibility (install.sh never
#                        writes or downloads this file).
#   GH_RUNNER_REPO       "owner/repo" this runner registers against.
#
# Optional env:
#   GH_INSTALLATION_ID   Skip the /repos/{repo}/installation lookup if the
#                        installation id is already known.
#   GH_RUNNER_GROUP       Runner group id for jitconfig (default: 1, GitHub's
#                        default group -- not a secret).
#   GH_WORK_FOLDER        work_folder for generate-jitconfig (default under
#                        /Users/Shared, namespaced to this track so it never
#                        collides with an unrelated runner's job root).
#   BOX_RUNNER_APP_ENV    Optional env file sourced BEFORE the required vars
#                        above are read, so a box can pin its own values
#                        without editing this script (mirrors the original
#                        lineage's on-box gh-app.env precedence,
#                        generalized to any operator-chosen path/name via
#                        install.sh). A missing/unreadable file is not an
#                        error -- it simply means every value above must
#                        already be in the environment.
#
# Credential-exposure hardening carried over unchanged from the box-3
# lineage (see the original for the incident this was hardened against):
#   * The RS256 JWT and the installation token are NEVER placed on a curl
#     command line -- curl_auth() feeds the Authorization header to curl via
#     `--config -` (stdin), so no secret ever appears in this process's argv,
#     `ps` output, or a crash dump.
#   * The installation token minted for jitconfig is SCOPED to exactly this
#     one repository (administration:write + metadata:read), so a stolen
#     jitconfig-path token cannot touch any other repo or hold broader
#     permissions.
#   * That token is REVOKED (DELETE /installation/token) on every exit path
#     (normal return, INT, TERM), shrinking its live window from the ~1h
#     GitHub grants to the few seconds this script actually uses it.
#   * No secret is ever written to disk or a durable env var. No `set -x`,
#     no curl `-v` (either would echo the bearer token).
