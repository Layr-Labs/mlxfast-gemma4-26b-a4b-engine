# supervisor.sh -- mint -> run -> reap loop that makes a box serve GitHub
# Actions jobs for this repository's ranked benchmark, one job at a time.
#
# Adapted from the box-3-proven qwen/bench lineage
# (the operator's machine-scripts repository, READ-ONLY reference -- this
# script does not modify that repo or anything in it)
# with its JIT registration pattern kept and its orphan bug fixed. Quoting
# the box-3 lesson this script exists to fix, verbatim from that reference's
# header (supervisor.sh:2-30 there):
#
#   > Loop, one iteration per job:
#   >   ...
#   >   4. Start actions-runner with that JIT config as the `runner` user and
#   >      wait for it to exit. JIT runners are single-job by construction
#   >      (equivalent to --ephemeral): the registration is consumed by
#   >      exactly one job.
#   >   ...
#   > One job at a time is guaranteed by the JIT/ephemeral registration; the
#   > supervisor never runs two runner processes concurrently and adds no
#   > other concurrency.
#
# and the spawn line itself (supervisor.sh:158 there):
#
#   > su - "${RUNNER_USER}" -c "... ${timeout_bin} ./run.sh"
#
# THE BUG: `su -` starts a NEW LOGIN SESSION. When launchd stops the
# supervisor daemon (crash, `launchctl bootout`, an operator's kickstart),
# the signal targets the DAEMON'S OWN process group -- and the su-spawned
# runner session was never a member of it, so it is not reached even though
# both were alive at that instant. The job tree becomes a live orphan that
# outlives the daemon that was supposed to manage it, and nothing before had
# a way to find or stop it short of an operator manually hunting `ps`.
#
# THE FIX (this script + lib/pidtree.sh): the job's root pid is written to
# PID_FILE the instant it is known, BEFORE this process waits on it, so the
# tree is discoverable by ANY later invocation -- not just this one, and not
# only while this process is alive. `stop` (below) reads that pid and asks
# lib/pidtree.sh to walk the LIVE PARENT-PID CHAIN from it (a kernel fact
# independent of session id or process group, so `su -`'s session boundary
# does not hide anything from it) and kill every descendant found. `run`
# calls the exact same reap at startup, before minting a new job, so
# restarting the daemon after an ungraceful death (the box-3 scenario)
# actually recovers instead of leaking a second concurrent job tree. See
# lib/pidtree.sh's header for the full mechanism.
#
# Also carried forward unchanged from the reference (supervisor.sh:130-142
# there), because it is a distinct, still-load-bearing hardening and this
# script keeps the same technique: the JIT config crosses to the runner OFF
# argv, via the ACTIONS_RUNNER_INPUT_JITCONFIG env var (the actions-runner's
# own env-input mechanism), so no other uid can scrape it from `ps`. Neither
# the App key nor any token this process's gh-app-mint.sh mints ever enters
# the runner's environment or argv.
#
# Usage:
#   supervisor.sh [run]     Run the mint/spawn/reap loop (default; foreground
#                            -- a launchd plist installed by install.sh is
#                            what keeps it running as a daemon).
#   supervisor.sh stop      Standalone entrypoint: if a job tree is tracked
#                            (PID_FILE), kill it (TERM, wait, KILL survivors)
#                            and clear the tracking file. Safe to call any
#                            time, including when this script's own `run`
#                            process is no longer alive -- that is precisely
#                            the box-3 recovery case above.
#   supervisor.sh status     Print `idle`, or `running: ...` plus one `ps`
#                            line per live process in the current job's
#                            tree -- the between-jobs quiescence check.
#
