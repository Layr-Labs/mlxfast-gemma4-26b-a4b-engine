# fetch-goldens.sh -- fetch one pin-verified object from the track's R2 bucket

#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# READ THIS BEFORE ASSUMING THIS SCRIPT GIVES YOU A LOCAL CALIBRATION GOLDEN.
#
# As of this commit there is NO PUBLIC GOLDEN PIN in this repository, so there
# is nothing here for a participant to fetch yet. That is a finding, not an
# omission in this script:
#
#   * Every {r2_path, sha256, bytes} pin in fixtures/gemma4_26b_a4b_track.json
#     is HIDDEN material -- the 8 `timed_prompt_pool[]` tapes and the
#     `hidden_correctness_golden` oracle. They are organizer/box-side by
#     construction: the GETs are CREDENTIALED (SigV4, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID /
#     R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), so a participant clone cannot fetch them even if
#     it tried, and this script REFUSES to try (see "the hidden guard" below).
#     They are also the wrong FORMAT for local iteration: pool objects are
#     benchd `TimedPromptTapeDocument` tapes with `deny_unknown_fields`, not
#     the `--golden` documents `MLXFAST_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH` names.
#
#   * The one correctness golden a participant legitimately has today needs no
#     fetching at all: correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_1024_256.json
#     is CHECKED INTO GIT (gemma provenance -- `model_provenance.repository` is
#     the pinned mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit @ 0e3cbab3), and it
#     is what `defaultCorrectnessGoldenPath()` in Sources/MLXFastCLI/main.swift
#     already falls back to via MLXFAST_PUBLIC_CORRECTNESS_GOLDEN_PATH. A
#     `yukon clone` gets it in the clone.
#
# So this script exists ARMED AND UNUSED on the participant path: the transport
# and the pin verification are real and tested, keyed on explicit arguments, so
# that publishing a public local-calibration golden is a one-line invocation
# plus a documented pin -- not another lane. WHICH object that should be, and
# what its pin is, is an ORGANIZER DECISION and is deliberately not invented
# here.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE R2 CONVENTION THIS MIRRORS (do not re-derive it):
#   * The base URL lives in the environment variable R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT and
#     NOWHERE ELSE. It is secret-tier: never hardcode an endpoint, a bucket
#     name, or an account host in this repository. Ask the organizer for the
#     R2 base.
#   * The BUCKET IS PART OF THE ENDPOINT, never part of r2_path. Prefixing the
#     bucket onto the object key is the documented way to waste a day; the
#     qwen/dflash runbooks record it costing three ranked dispatches.
#   * Object keys live under correctness_prompts/<track_id>/, which is also the
#     branch name and the track id -- one string, three roles.
#   * Verify BYTE COUNT FIRST, then sha256, and delete the file on either
#     mismatch: a truncated transfer is the common failure and the byte count
#     names it precisely, where a bare hash mismatch does not.
#   This mirrors .github/scripts/download-r2-object.sh and
#   scripts/verify-cuda-track-pins.sh --fetch on the qwen/cuda tracks; neither
#   exists in this repository, which is why the credentialed transport here is
#   DELEGATED rather than reimplemented (a second hand-rolled SigV4 signer is
#   exactly the wrong thing to own twice).
#
# Usage:
#   tools/fetch-goldens.sh --r2-path KEY --sha256 HEX --bytes N --out FILE
#
# Env:
#   R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT   REQUIRED. https://<host>[/<bucket>[/<prefix>...]].
#                        Ask the organizer; keep it in .env, never in a repo.
#   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID     Optional. Set (with the secret below) to take the
#   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   credentialed path via a delegated downloader.
#                        Unset => a plain anonymous HTTPS GET, which is all a
#                        public object needs.
#   MLXFAST_GEMMA4_R2_DOWNLOADER
#                        Path to a `download-r2-object.sh KEY DEST` compatible
#                        signer for the credentialed path. No default: this
#                        repository ships no signer.

Usage: tools/fetch-goldens.sh --r2-path KEY --sha256 HEX --bytes N --out FILE

Fetch one object from the track's R2 bucket and accept it only if it matches
the supplied {sha256, bytes} pin exactly. The file is removed on any mismatch,
so a failed run never leaves half-verified bytes behind.

  --r2-path KEY   Object key, e.g. correctness_prompts/gemma4-26b-a4b-mlx-v1/NAME.json
                  The BUCKET IS NOT PART OF THIS -- it is in R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT.
  --sha256 HEX    64 lowercase hex characters. Required: there is no unpinned fetch.
  --bytes N       Exact byte count. Required, and checked before the hash.
  --out FILE      Destination path.
  --allow-hidden  Organizer/box escape hatch; see below. Needs credentials too.

THE R2 BASE URL COMES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT ONLY:

  export R2_BUCKET_ENDPOINT='https://<host>/<bucket>'   # ASK THE ORGANIZER

It is secret-tier material. It is deliberately absent from this repository and
must stay that way -- keep it in your .env, never in a file you commit.

NO PUBLIC GOLDEN IS PINNED FOR THIS TRACK YET, so there is currently nothing a
participant should be fetching with this. The correctness golden local runs
already use is checked into the clone at
correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_1024_256.json.

THE HIDDEN GUARD: every pin in fixtures/gemma4_26b_a4b_track.json (the 8
timed_prompt_pool tapes and hidden_correctness_golden) is hidden, box-only
material. This script refuses to fetch any of them by key OR by digest, so a
copy-pasted pin from the contract cannot quietly pull hidden bytes onto a
participant machine. --allow-hidden lifts that refusal for organizer-side
provisioning and additionally requires R2 credentials to be present.

It matches a timed_prompt_pool[] tape or hidden_correctness_golden in
fixtures/gemma4_26b_a4b_track.json. Those objects are organizer-side: the GETs
are credentialed, the tapes are a benchd format local --golden modes cannot
load, and the anti-lottery cohort stops being hidden the moment a participant
holds all eight.

If you are the organizer provisioning a box, pass --allow-hidden (credentials
are required as well). If you are looking for a golden to iterate against
locally, the checked-in one is
correctness_prompts/public_longcopy_gate_english_1024_256.json -- no fetch
needed.
