# Unit test for tools/fetch-goldens.sh. Offline, no GPU, no real R2 -- a
# throwaway python3 http.server on 127.0.0.1 stands in for the bucket, so the
# URL assembly (endpoint + "/" + r2_path) and the pin verification are
# exercised against real bytes over a real socket without any credential, any
# network egress, or any hidden material.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, and it is the part worth having: the REFUSAL paths. A
# fetcher that accepts good bytes is easy; one that reliably rejects a
# one-byte-short transfer, a digest mismatch, and a hidden pin -- and leaves no
# partial file behind when it does -- is the thing the pin discipline actually
# rests on.

# Usage: tools/test-fetch-goldens.sh
